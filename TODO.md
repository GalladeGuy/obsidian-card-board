- build todos from markdown content
- make it switch to the kanban window when shown
- filter into 2 groups: incomplete and done
- display on simple 2 colum board: todo & done
- make sure there can only be one Kanban window no matter how many times the icon is clicked

- put the target in dist
  - put the static sources in an assets dir and copy them into dist on build too
- elm review
- elm debugger
- why does the compilation fail with  TS2307: Cannot find module '../src/Main' or its corresponding type declarations.


# Done
- pass pages into elm for parsing for todo
- elm typescript interop
- elm format
- put an elm application in the Kanban window
