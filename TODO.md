- pass pages into elm for parsing for todo
- elm debugger
- why does the compilation fail with  TS2307: Cannot find module '../src/Main' or its corresponding type declarations.
- make sure there can only be one Kanban window no matter how many times the icon is clicked
- make it switch to the kanban window when shown
- scan todos in all files
- filter into 2 groups: incomplete and done
- display on simple 2 colum board: todo & done

# Done
- elm typescript interop
- elm format
- put an elm application in the Kanban window
